**Update 2.3**

- Fixed all known issues:
  - Fixed modules
  - Fixed "Database is locked"
  - Fixed not stopping on Ctrl+C (now u can stop the ub using Ctrl+C!)
- Added param `DISABLE_DEFAULT_LINK_PREVIEW` (default: False): If True: Link previews are disabled by default, unless specified otherwise in the modules
- Fixed long running on Termux/UserLAnd (But this doesn't give a 100% guarantee that everything will work, these are emulators, hacks)
